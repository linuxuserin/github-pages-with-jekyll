Troubleshooting build errors

If Jekyll encounters an error building your GitHub Pages site locally or on GitHub, you can use error messages to troubleshoot. For more information about error messages and how to view them, see "About Jekyll build errors for GitHub Pages sites."

If you received a generic error message, check for common issues.

    You're using unsupported plugins. For more information, see "About GitHub Pages and Jekyll."
    Your repository has exceeded our repository size limits. For more information, see "What is my disk quota?"
    You changed the source setting in your _config.yml file. GitHub Pages overrides this setting during the build process.
    A filename in your publishing source contains a colon (:) which is not supported.

If you received a specific error message, review the troubleshooting information for the error message below.
